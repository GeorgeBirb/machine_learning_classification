# Machine Learning Classification

This is a repository for my Master's thesis about machine learning algorithms for classification in Python. It contains four data sets that I will use to test some classification algorithms.

## Data sets

All the datasets can be found at the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) in csv format with their description.
The data sets being used for this project are listed below:
- Bank Marketing Data Set: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)
- Car Evaluation Data Set: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation)
- Default of credit card clients Data Set: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients)
- Auto MPG Data Set: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG)


## Installation 

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install  the dependencies for the project listed below:

- pandas
- pandas-profiling
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- jupyterlab

or just use the *requirements.txt* file found [here](https://github.com/mariosfish/machine_learning_classification/blob/master/requirements.txt) to install them as below:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To launch a new Jupyter notebook open a command prompt and type:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
After opening the browser, open an *.ipynb* file and run it. You can also add your code or edit the existing one to your desires.
